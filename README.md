# Sorting-Algorithms
A range of different data sorting algorithms.

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. 
Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that 
require input data to be in sorted lists.
